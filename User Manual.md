## Updating Models

If the user navigates to a model detail page and clicks the *Upload*
button, they will be prompted to upload a .json file to update the
current model. It is important to note that in this current state if you
update a component of a model that is potentially used by other models
it will be rolled back unless you also update the UUID for this
component.

## Searching for Models

If the user clicks the *Search* button in the navigation bar, they will
be directed to a search page where they can look for models and filter
results by model name or creator name.

Alternatively, if the user searches for a model directly using the
search bar in the navigation bar, they will be directed to the search
page with the results already populated.
